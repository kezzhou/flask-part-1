## HHA 504 - Cloud Computing: Flask Application Part 1

## In this assignment we experiment with the basics of setting up and deploying flask to a local and remote (in this case GCP and Azure) environment for testing.

## Part 1 concerns local launch and part 2 concerns remote launch

## A pip freeze command has been used to create requirements.txt, though the most important requirement is flask (of which version and source has been included). Otherwise it may be helpful for any unexpected compatibility issues.
